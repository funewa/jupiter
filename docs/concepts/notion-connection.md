# The Notion Connection

Jupiter currently uses Notion as the main user interface.

There is some ceremony involved in maintaining the link between them.

In `jupiter init` you need to specify some [parameters](../tutorial.md) to link Notion and Jupiter together.

From time to time you need to invoke `jupiter notion-connection-update-token` to
[update the access token](../how-tos/update-an-expired-token.md).
