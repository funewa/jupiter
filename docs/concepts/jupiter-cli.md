# The Jupiter CLI

The Jupiter CLI is the "official" interface to Jupiter. The CLI stands for "command line interface". As opposed to a
GUI or "graphical user interface". Most applications you interact with - your browser or your email client on your
computer, or YouTube or Instagram on your phone - are GUI ones. CLIs are much simpler tools, but because you need
to interact with them via a [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) and _type_ commands to get
things done, they're mostly used by _power-users_.

You can do all operations through it, though for most you'll prefer the Notion interface. For a couple however you'll
need the CLI - [sync-ing](notion-local-sync.md), [running reports](reporting.md),
[task generation](tasks-generation.md) or [garbage collection](garbage-collection.md).

The CLI essentially manages the [local storage](local-storage.md) and applies any change to Notion too.

Checkout how to [install it](../install.md) and some basic usage in [the tutorial](../tutorial.md).
