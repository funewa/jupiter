# Jupiter

## About

Jupiter is a small tool for _life planning_. It provides goals management, task tracking,
habit building, smart lists, metrics, a personal relationship manager, etc. all in a unified package.

I built it to [solve an issue I had](http://www.paulgraham.com/organic.html) - making sure everything
I wanted to get done actually got done, while juggling the standard complexities of life - family, kids, career, etc.

The current version adds a bunch of magic to [Notion.so](https://notion.so) - an
already existing and great productivity app which is a sort of cross between Trello,
Jira, and Confluence.

While Notion acts as the main user interface, a CLI app takes care of large scale tasks such
as backup, recurring tasks generation, Notion environment cleanup, etc. It also mirrors the
functionality available through Notion, for the console heads among us.

Here's a picture from it:
