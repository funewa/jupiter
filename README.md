# The Jupiter Goal Management System #

Jupiter is a small application for goals management, task tracking, habit building, and all that jazz. More precisely it adds a bunch of magic to [Notion.so](https://notion.so) - an already existing and quite good productivity app which is a sort of cross between Trello, Jira, and Confluence. The “magic” is just a bunch of conventions on how work is organized. There is a growing set of CLI scripts for maintaining these conventions and automating such things like recurring task creation, task archival, etc. But yeah, you read that right, it's a CLI app right now. It’s a surprisingly convenient form given that most of the interaction happens via Notion.

Here's a demo of it in action:
