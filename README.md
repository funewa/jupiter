# The Jupiter Goal Management System ![Normal Push](https://github.com/horia141/jupiter/workflows/Normal%20Push/badge.svg) ![Release](https://github.com/horia141/jupiter/workflows/Release/badge.svg) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/jupiter-goals/badge/?version=stable)](https://jupiter-goals.readthedocs.io/en/stable/?badge=stable)

Jupiter is a small tool for _life planning_, meaning goals management, task tracking,
habit building, metrics tracking, etc.

The current version adds a bunch of magic to [Notion.so](https://notion.so) - an
already existing and great productivity app which is a sort of cross between Trello,
Jira, and Confluence. The “magic” is just a bunch of conventions on how work is
organized. There is a growing set of CLI scripts for maintaining these conventions
and automating such things like recurring task creation, task archival, etc.

Here's a demo of it in action:
